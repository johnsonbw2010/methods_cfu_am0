# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel about your use of built-in Ruby methods?
    - With the help of the ruby documentation, I feel confident. There is a LOT of information yet to learn, but I feel good about where I stand.
- How confident do you feel writing simple methods of your own?
    - I feel very confident in my ability to write *simple* methods. More complexity will definitely take some study time.
- What questions do you have about methods, and what they are capable of? (ask a question!!!)
    - A lot of my reading brought me to regexp which I don't believe we've covered - I was wondering what exactly that is. From what I can gather, it appears to be a set of rules of some sort, but would love clarification!
