# Run each line of code below (either from this file or in IRB individually).
#  Then, in a ruby comment, write 1-2 sentences describing what is happening, using ALL the involved vocabulary terms you've learned in this lesson so far.

# EXAMPLE
# The downcase method is called on the string object "Hello World"
# No arguments are passed; downcase has one clear job which is to lowercase all letters that exist in the String
# The return value is "hello world"
"Hello World".downcase

# YOU DO the rest:

# The .include? method is called on the string object "Hello World"
# The parameter ("Hello") informs the .include? method to check the string "Hello World" for the inclusion of the string "Hello".
# The return value is true.
"Hello World".include?("Hello")

# The .end_with? method is called on the string object "Hello World"
# The parameter ("Hello") informs the .end_with? method to check the string "Hello World" to see if it ends with "Hello"
# The return value is false.
"Hello World".end_with?("Hello")

# The end_with? method is called on the string "Hello World"
# The parameter ("rld") informs the .end_with? method to check if the string "Hello World" ends in "rld".
# The return value is true.
"Hello World".end_with?("rld")

# The .even? method is called on the integer 12
# The .even? method solves whether or not the integer is divisible by 2.
# The return value is true.
12.even?

# The .next method is called on the integer 18
# The .next method returns the next sequential integer following the given one.
# The return value is 19.
18.next
